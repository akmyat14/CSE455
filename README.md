# CSE455

Generaly worked well with simpler neural network architectures because teh more complex ones would get stuck at local minima even with constant learning rates. I think the scope of my project
was too high initially so I took a lot of time tuning a lot of hyperparameters for the complex neural networks instead of starting from a simple one. My accuracies were generally quite poor as a result.
